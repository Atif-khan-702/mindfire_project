This Online Parlour Appointment System will provide an online platform to the customers to book their appointment at any Parlour based on their searched locality. Customer will get their token number from the respective parlour and the estimate waiting time for his/her service after booking.

Initially, customers used to wait in queue at parlours in weekend or in peak hours. This was actually wastage of time. Customers who are new in city had lot of trouble finding the parlour of their choice.
